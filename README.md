# Neural Network from Scratch
In this notebook `mnist-nn-from-scratch.ipynb`, I implemented a three-layer neural network by only using the `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` libraries.

This notebook was mainly for my own understanding of how neural networks worked without using libraries. The link to the Kaggle dataset can be found: https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer.
